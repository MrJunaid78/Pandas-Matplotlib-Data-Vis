# Pandas with Matplotlib & Seaborn Data Visualisation

The ipynb file is the file containing all the analysis and various data transformation and visualisation techniques used.

It is analysing a demo data of employees and product names and salary, using Pandas to manipulate data and then using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualise the data.

The final step of the process transforms the data into a html file which can opened anywhere to make the data more interactive and easier to use even for stakeholders who do not wish to go into too much into the specifics and want the final report.
